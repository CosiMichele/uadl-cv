## Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to CV

CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Revisiting CNN:

- CNNs are a class of deep neural networks designed for processing **grid-like data**, primarily used for image analysis.
- They consist of *layers* that automatically learn *hierarchical features* from input data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
- Convolutional layers use learnable filters to extract features from local regions of the input.
- Pooling layers downsample feature maps, preserving important information and reducing spatial dimensions.
- Fully connected layers at the end of the network make class predictions based on the learned features.
- They excel at capturing intricate patterns and are robust to variations like object positioning in images.
- Benefits include hierarchical feature learning, translation invariance, scalability, and state-of-the-art performance in visual tasks.
- CNNs have transformed how we approach image analysis, automating feature extraction and enabling end-to-end learning.
